## Week 3 assignment: create function cacheSolve
## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix 
## has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
## Notes: Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function 
## in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
## For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
